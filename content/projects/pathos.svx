# Pathos

Pathos was born out of frustration with vague "10x productivity" claims and opaque metrics that fail to capture how developers actually spend their time. I wanted to create a private, opt-in way for indie developers and teams to gain genuine insights into their coding patterns without sacrificing privacy or simplicity.

This VS Code extension transforms local development activity into meaningful, shareable productivity insights. Unlike traditional time-tracking tools that focus on crude hour counts, Pathos emphasizes understanding work patterns, language preferences, and sustainable coding rhythms.

The extension provides secure GitHub OAuth integration with intelligent repository provisioning, allowing developers to spin up workspace-specific repositories directly from VS Code. Users can configure visibility settings, choose licensing options, and select from curated README templates—all without leaving their editor.

At the core of Pathos is MiniWatch, a lightweight file watcher that captures edit bursts, commit cadence, and language focus patterns. Crucially, no raw code is ever transmitted—only anonymized activity metadata. This privacy-first approach ensures developers maintain full control over their intellectual property while still gaining valuable insights.

The Gemini-powered summary system converts weeks of telemetry logs into narrative progress reports. These promptable insights can be formatted as meeting-ready highlights, personal retrospectives, or team performance overviews. Visual Mermaid dashboards complement the narrative reports with timeline views and streak charts that keep motivation high and provide clear progress visualization.

Built entirely in TypeScript, Pathos runs with minimal overhead in VS Code while leveraging a companion Node.js service hosted on Render for OAuth flows and report generation. The architecture prioritizes performance and user privacy throughout.

The extension crossed 50 installs with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating in its first month on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, demonstrating strong early adoption and user satisfaction among developers seeking authentic productivity insights.
