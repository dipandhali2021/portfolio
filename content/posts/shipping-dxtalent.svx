I started DXTalent because friends at IIITDM kept asking for a structured way to learn digital
transformation skills without drowning in enterprise jargon. Here are a few lessons from sprinting the
first version into the world:

1. **Scope your AI surface area.** Gemini was great at drafting lesson blueprints, but only after I fed it
   real DX maturity data and a templatized voice. Guardrails > magic.
2. **Gamification must feel earned.** Six leagues and twenty badges sound fun until you try to prevent
   cheating. I added server-side validation and human spot checks before unlocking anything.
3. **Charge early.** Integrating Stripe from day one forced me to define what "value" meant for learners vs
   recruiters. That clarity shaped the roadmap more than any OKR doc.

I’m now layering in observability so that teams can see their CI/CD and culture metrics improve alongside
curated lessons. If you want a walkthrough, ping me via the contact links below.
